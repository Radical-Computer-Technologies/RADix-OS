# Pi Zero 2 W Bring-Up {#pi_zero2w}

RADPx-OS now has the first pieces of the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W port. Raspberry
Pi firmware remains the real first-stage boot path: the GPU ROM, `bootcode.bin`,
and `start4.elf` initialize RAM, read `config.txt`, load the ARM payload, and
release the AArch64 cores. The RADPx-OS-specific second stage is optional, but it
is still useful as a maintenance loader for future boot menus, kernel selection,
reflash tools, handoff validation, and hardware policy.

The intended final shape is:

- Pi firmware performs first-stage hardware boot.
- A narrow Circle-based second-stage loader can load `RADKRN.IMG` from the
  FAT boot partition and jump through `rad_boot_handoff_t`.
- The standalone RADPx-OS payload uses the `bcm283x_pi` backend and does not link
  Circle.

## Required Loader State

The handoff is intentionally strict for physical silicon. Before jumping from
any second-stage loader to the RADPx-OS payload, the loader must:

- Park secondary cores 1-3 in a clean `wfe` loop owned by the loader handoff.
- Mask interrupts on core 0.
- Disable the MMU and data cache.
- Clean/invalidate data cache state covering the payload and handoff record.
- Invalidate the instruction cache and TLB.
- Jump to the RADPx-OS entry in AArch64 EL1.

`radboot_validate_handoff()` rejects Pi handoff records that do not declare
these conditions through the `RAD_BOOT_HANDOFF_FLAG_*` safety bits.

## Current Payload

Build the standalone payload with:

```bash
make -C tools/embedded/rad_pi_zero2w
```

The output files are:

- `tools/embedded/rad_pi_zero2w/RADKRN.ELF`
- `tools/embedded/rad_pi_zero2w/RADKRN.IMG`

Run the RADPx-OS-owned QEMU smoke test with:

```bash
tools/embedded/rad_pi_zero2w_smoke.sh
```

The script uses `qemu-system-aarch64 -M raspi3b` because QEMU does not expose a
Pi Zero 2 W machine model. If `qemu-system-aarch64` is not installed, the smoke
test downloads and extracts Ubuntu's `qemu-system-arm` package under
`.radbuild/qemu-arm` and reuses it on later runs. A passing run verifies the
early BCM283x HAL, PL011 UART, mailbox framebuffer, handoff validation, payload
entry, block and FAT mount scaffolds, USB/input scaffolds, framebuffer dirty
present, A53 MMU/table setup, process/COW checks, and Slint/RADCompositor
parity markers.

The current RAD-owned backend includes:

- A platform split under `RADKernel/platforms`: portable A53 code in
  `platforms/a53` and Pi-specific BCM283x drivers in `platforms/a53/bcm283x`.
- PL011 serial console registration.
- System timer reads and busy sleep.
- Interrupt enable/disable hooks for the BCM interrupt controller.
- Mailbox property framebuffer allocation and `/dev/fb0` registration.
- `/dev/mmcblk0` block-device registration scaffold with in-memory sector
  backing for QEMU smoke reads.
- `/dev/usb0` host-info scaffold and `/dev/input/event0` synthetic HID input
  event path.
- A portable A53 MMU/process layer with 4 KiB translation-table construction,
  TTBR0 process roots, a TTBR1 kernel root, user-copy validation, COW
  page-fault handling, syscall dispatch framing, and kernel process-table
  fork/fd-clone/wait checks.
- Slint/RADCompositor boot-shell, window-manager, terminal-window, and
  compositor-damage smoke markers.

## Circle Loader Gate

Run the combined loader/payload smoke test with:

```bash
tools/embedded/qemu_pizero2w_smoke.sh
```

The Circle loader source now builds a narrow second-stage handoff record and
emits loader-intent markers when serial output is visible. On this workstation
the Circle image currently reaches QEMU without serial markers, so the combined
smoke script treats the Circle image as a build gate and then runs the
standalone RADPx-OS payload gate. Physical Pi hardware remains the next authority
for validating the actual Circle FAT load and jump sequence.

## Current Limits

This page is experimental. The portable A53 layer now builds real page tables
and enables the MMU in the standalone payload, but full EL0 ELF execution,
preemptive user scheduling, and complete exec image replacement are still not at
x86 parity. The eMMC, USB, HID, and Slint shell paths are still QEMU-visible
scaffolds rather than complete physical drivers. The next Pi passes need the
real BCM283x eMMC command engine, real DWC OTG host enumeration, hardware
keyboard/mouse input, second-stage FAT load/jump validation on silicon, and full
AArch64 userspace execution parity.

Physical Pi Zero 2 W hardware remains the authority for mailbox framebuffer and
SD behavior.
